Task: Build a Book Listing Web Application

You are required to build a simple web application that allows users to view, add, and delete books. The application should have both frontend and backend functionality.

Requirements:

1. Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS)
   - Build a responsive web interface where users can:
     - View a list of books (title, author, description).
     - Add a new book (with fields for title, author, and description).
     - Delete a book.
   - Use React.js for the UI and Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. Backend (Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB)
   - Create an API to:
     - Get all books (GET `/books`)
     - Add a book (POST `/books`)
     - Delete a book by ID (DELETE `/books/:id`)
   - Use MongoDB to store the book data.

Deliverables:
1. Host the project online using a free platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify for frontend, and MongoDB Atlas for the database).
2. Share the live URL of the application.
3. Postman collection or instructions for testing the API.

Bonus:
- Implement basic form validation when adding a book (e.g., all fields are required).
